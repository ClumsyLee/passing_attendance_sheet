# Passing Attendance Sheet

## Origin
I take a listening and speaking English class this semester, and the foreign teacher use an attendance sheet to record participation of each student. Usually, he'll give the sheet to one of the student at the beginning of a class, letting the sheet passing around the classroom.

However, when someone passes the sheet back to him, there are always some students who haven't singed yet. This makes me wonder:
* How long will it take to have everyone signed the attendance sheet? 
* What is the relation between the size of the class room and the time?

I just want to figure it out, so I make this simulation, to find out the
*"function"* behind the phenomenon. So here it is.
